These scripts are identical in function to the main directory scripts.  The only difference
being troubleshoot scripts contain more verbose comments and print statements to track calculation steps.

### Note

Move cryptanalysis-troubleshooting.py up one folder to properly access the dictionary file in `doc/dictionary.txt` and the decrypt function from decrypt.py
