# Three favorite pizzas in a list.
pizzas = ['cheese', 'pepperoni', 'supreme']

# Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza.
for pizza in pizzas:
    print("I love " + pizza + " pizza!")

# Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
# how much you like pizza.
print("\nYou can tell I really enjoy pizza!")
